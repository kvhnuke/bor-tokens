## How to contribute

### Contribution  Guidelines
We believe one of the things that makes Polygon special is its coherent design and we seek to retain this defining characteristic. From the outset we defined some guidelines to ensure new contributions only ever enhance the project:

* Quality: Code in the Polygon project should meet the style guidelines, with sufficient test-cases, descriptive commit messages, evidence that the contribution does not break any compatibility commitments or cause adverse feature interactions, and evidence of high-quality peer-review
* Size: The Polygon project’s culture is one of small pull-requests, regularly submitted. The larger a pull-request, the more likely it is that you will be asked to resubmit as a series of self-contained and individually reviewable smaller PRs
* Maintainability: If the feature will require ongoing maintenance (eg support for a particular brand of database), we may ask you to accept responsibility for maintaining this feature
### Submit an issue

- Create a [new issue](https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor/issues/new/choose)
- Comment on the issue (if you'd like to be assigned to it) - that way [our team can assign the issue to you](https://github.blog/2019-06-25-assign-issues-to-issue-commenters/).
- If you do not have a specific contribution in mind, you can also browse the issues labelled as `help wanted`
- Issues that additionally have the `good first issue` label are considered ideal for first-timers

### Fork the repository (repo)

- If you're not sure, here's how to [fork the repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)

- If this is your first time forking our repo, this is all you need to do for this step:

    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:[your_github_handle]/bor
    ```

- If you've already forked the repo, you'll want to ensure your fork is configured and that it's up to date. This will save you the headache of potential merge conflicts.

- To [configure your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork):

    ```
    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/maticnetwork/bor
    ```

- To [sync your fork with the latest changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork):

    ```
    $ git checkout master
    $ git fetch upstream
    $ git merge upstream/master
    ```

### Building the source

- Building `bor` requires both a Go (version 1.14 or later) and a C compiler. You can install
them using your favourite package manager. Once the dependencies are installed, run

     ```shell
     $ make bor
     ```

- or, to build the full suite of utilities:

     ```shell
     $ make bor-all
     ```
